### So ... i want to present you this tool which i made for automatic runes getting and setting !

not like blitz or professor.gg .. my program's memory and CPU using are incredible !. 
So .. if you have a 🥔 PC and you can't use blitz or professor.gg because of the performance issues 😕 , you can use this tool .... does the job + Memory friendly HaveFun <3 
# How to use it ? 
well ... you can right click the system tray icon and click show tutorial and it will explain it to you .. but there is one important thing ... 
*Run LMR after you open League client*
and every time you will restart lol ... u need to restart LickMyRunes
# what about .. ban 🚫 ?
My program soon will be registered for riot developers ... 
which means its completely safe to use it
